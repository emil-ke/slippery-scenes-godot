# Slippery Scenes

#### Usage

Install and enable the plugin. Then, in the editor, pressing `<Ctrl-f>` opens the plugin's popup window. From here we can search through the editor's currently opened scenes. This allows for a quick keyboard-based navigation rather than having to sift through the the tab bar in Godot's built-in UI. It is especially useful if you have many scenes opened and switch between them often.

#### Note

Right now the shortcut is fairly hardcoded. If you don't want to use `<Ctrl-f>` to launch the popup, you can change the shortcut definition at the top of the script at `res://addons/slippery_scenes/slippery_scenes.gd`
