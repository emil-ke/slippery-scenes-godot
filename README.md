# Slippery Scenes

- Usage:

Install and enable plugin. Then, in the editor, pressing <Ctrl-f> opens the plugin's popup window. From here can we can search through the currently opened scenes in the editor. This allows for a quick keyboard-based navigation rather than having to sift through the the tab bar in Godot's built-in UI. It is especially useful if you have many scenes opened and switch between them often.
