# Slippery Scenes

- Usage:

Install and enable the plugin. Then, in the editor, pressing `<Ctrl-f>` opens the plugin's popup window. From here we can search through the editor's currently opened scenes. This allows for a quick keyboard-based navigation rather than having to sift through the the tab bar in Godot's built-in UI. It is especially useful if you have many scenes opened and switch between them often.
